Ensure you are using Python 2.7 with the following installed:
1.opencv
2.tkinter
3.pickle
4.NumPy

Running the Program:
Ensure that the files "haarcascade_ff" and "faces.pickle" are in the same directory.
Double click "FaceRecognitionandDetection" and an interface with buttons should open.
If the program doesn't work, double click ResetandDebug which runs a script to reset the dictionary and clear "faces.pickle".

Using the Program:
If there are no faces recorded, the recognise button does nothing.
Type the name of the person whose face is being recorded and click the record faces button.
After all people who have to be recognised are recorded you can click the recognise faces button and it should detect faces.
The clear faces button clears the saved records.
The save faces button saves the faces recognised into a text file in the same directory.
